            <p>
              I would say i had a difficult time starting in college, due the
              fact it started at the rise of the pandemic. Everybody would start
              adjusting to the new way of learning. At the start, i actually
              prepared myself especially in programming, because in my Senior
              High i haven't experience any coding related subjects, but with
              diligence i actually enjoyed my programming subjects. I appreciate
              that DLS-CSB has provided me with the chance to learn my course
              correctly under the guidance of the right lecturers. During my
              time in college, I had no trouble making friends. Everyone I've
              come into contact with has been kind, accommodating, and caring.
              Since knowing how to write codes correctly was the only thing that
              mattered to me, I did not pay much attention to other subjects.
            </p>
            <h1 class="sub-title-2">Career Goals</h1>
            <p>
              For my Career Goals, i wanted to graduate on time and become a
              developer in a company that i want to work with. As i said before,
              i want to keep on improving on my coding and expand my learnings
              in terms of new coding either be making mobile application or
              different tech stack for web and mobile applications.
            </p>
            <h1 class="sub-title-2">Next Steps</h1>
            <p>
              If everything went good in my part in my career goals. The next
              steps would be able to keep on improving to code, creating
              different projects that are innovative and helpful towards other
              people. I also want to explore different types of area's in the
              coding environment, its always fun to learn new things and expand
              my knowledge.

                Booking flights is made easier with this online application,
                which offers separate features for administrators and users. A
                user-friendly design makes it simple for users to browse,
                compare, and book flights. It also provides access to booking
                history and pertinent updates. Administrators, on the other
                side, use CRUD operations and have specific tools for basic
                tasks like adding new flights, pilots, and airports. The
                application gives administrators the tools they need to maintain
                the system effectively and guarantees a dependable flight
                booking platform for consumers.
