              Hi, I'm Jan Mikhail Talanay I am a dedicated developer with more
              focuses in Web Applications and Mobile Applications. Taking up
              upon, Bachelor of Science in Information Systems degree. Learning
              from this degree has given me a solid basis on which on how to
              build and scalable and effective solutions. I work best in group
              settings, where i can use my knowledge that i have learned in my
              time in college to help build innovative applications

            <h1 class="sub-title-2">Reflections on College Life</h1>
            <p>
              I would say i had a difficult time starting in college, due the
              fact it started at the rise of the pandemic. Everybody would start
              adjusting to the new way of learning. At the start, i actually
              prepared myself especially in programming, because in my Senior
              High i haven't experience any coding related subjects, but with
              diligence i actually enjoyed my programming subjects. I appreciate
              that DLS-CSB has provided me with the chance to learn my course
              correctly under the guidance of the right lecturers. During my
              time in college, I had no trouble making friends. Everyone I've
              come into contact with has been kind, accommodating, and caring.
              Since knowing how to write codes correctly was the only thing that
              mattered to me, I did not pay much attention to other subjects.
            </p>
            <h1 class="sub-title-2">Career Goals</h1>
            <p>
              In pursuit of my career goals, my primary aim is to graduate on
              time and secure a position as a developer in a company aligned
              with my aspirations. Beyond this, I am driven by a deep-seated
              desire to continually enhance my coding skills and broaden my
              knowledge base. This involves venturing into new territories,
              whether it's delving into mobile application development or
              mastering various tech stacks for web and mobile applications. I
              am committed to embracing challenges and pushing my boundaries to
              realize my full potential in the dynamic field of software
              development. Additionally, I aim to actively seek mentorship
              opportunities and engage in networking to gain insights from
              seasoned professionals, thereby accelerating my growth trajectory
              in the industry.
            </p>
            <h1 class="sub-title-2">Next Steps</h1>
            <p>
              If everything goes well in my career journey, my next steps would
              involve continuous improvement in coding skills. I aim to create
              innovative projects that not only challenge me but also contribute
              positively to others' lives. Additionally, I aspire to explore
              various domains within the coding environment. Learning new
              technologies and methodologies excites me, and I believe it's
              essential to expand my knowledge base to adapt to the
              ever-evolving tech landscape

            <h2>Starting in OJT</h2>
            <p>
              When I began my internship at Gallium, it initially felt like a
              cultural shock to me, i was at first out of placed on how should i
              start and work, i was also at first very self-conscious. The way
              they demonstrated their work environment was surprisingly calm and
              relaxed. Everyone there was incredibly friendly and understanding,
              particularly towards us interns. Throughout my internship, I
              applied alongside some of my friends who were also interning at
              Gallium, and we had a lot of fun together during our time there.

            <h2>Learnings</h2>
            <p>
              During my internship, I learned a great deal, especially in my
              role as a junior developer. The company guided us through their
              tech stack, which included Docker, Node.js, Blitz, MariaDB,
              MongoDB, and React. Initially, they tasked us with becoming
              familiar with Docker and Node.js by providing documentation and
              examples. Throughout the internship, I gained insights into how a
              tech company collaborates for client projects. We were granted
              access to a Jira Board containing various tickets outlining tasks
              and deadlines. Following completion, we would demo the
              applications we developed.

              I didn't really have many because of how long and how involved
              each project was, but I will try to mention them all.<br /><br />

              The projects included a CV Generator App aimed at easing HR
              workload through candidate profile creation and resume uploads.
              Initially tasked with backend/API, I transitioned to frontend
              development and integration. Another project, the Employee CRUD,
              served as a precursor to the CV Generator, focusing on basic
              employee management. Despite its simplicity, it provided valuable
              insights into tech stack transitions, particularly in adopting
              nest.js with mongoDB integration.

                Professional has the access to it. The mobile application has

                Booking flights is made easier with this online application,
                which offers separate features for administrators and users. A
                user-friendly design makes it simple for users to browse,
                compare, and book flights. It also provides access to booking
                history and pertinent updates. Administrators, on the other
                side, use CRUD operations and have specific tools for basic
